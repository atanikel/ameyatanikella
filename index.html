    <b>Hi I am Ameya Tanikella</b><br/>
    here is a dump of facts <br/>
    ~math obsessed person, yet to learn calculus though :(<br/>
    ~knows PHP, python, html, css, js <br/>
    ~ self proclaimed hater of css(will say why later)<br/>
    ~ plays flute, violin, and a little bit of piano<br/>
    ~ violin is the best sounding instrument. no one can change my opinion on that <br/>
    ~ almost done with fantaisie impromptu, started on chopin etudes op 10 no 4, and etude op 25 no 2 on flute<br/>
    ~fantaisie impromptu i can't play this fast :(<br/><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzJPJ9o0mxI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    ~chopin etude op 25 no 2<br/>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CpO1Srsb_Oo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
    ~couldn't find etude op 10 no 4 on flute so too bad i guess <br/><br/><br/>
    this is by far my worst css on a website (well there is no css, this is just plaintext)<br/>
    go to these websites instead, i actually tried on them<br/>

    <a href="https://gui-calculator.ameya.repl.co">a simple calculator i made 4 years ago</a>
<br/>
    my other website isn't published yet but that's what made me hate css.
